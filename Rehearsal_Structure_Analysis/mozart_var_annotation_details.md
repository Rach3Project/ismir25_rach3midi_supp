### Similarity Matrixes of intra-group fragment pairs
The tick indexes reflect the bin numbers within the SSM of the whole rehearsal.

#### Diagonal Finding:

The light blue lines indicate the diagonals found using:
- minimum length = 10
- gap tolerance = 5
- similarity threshold = 0.2

The green lines represent group2 intervals, which we show to demonstrate the aforementioned challenges of this group specifically and how it affects the results. The intersections of the green lines is where we would (ideally) want to find a diagonal.

- For group 0:
3 long diags with enough coverage 
however, another diagonal subset is included which will likely lead to an irrelevant grouping, (the 3 short diagonals at the bottom). 
It could be avoided by increasing the minimum length parameter, or for it to be later discarded later based on improved filtering approaches. 

- As for group 1, there are 5 diagonals we would have wanted to find, only 2 of which actually have diagonals. The trille example
The example with the trille will be impossible to get a proper diagonal for. Not only is the number of events different, which makes the diagonal non exact even if the endings would be the same. and the notes are different (it is not repetition of the same note) [this is mozart var group 2 - 1 and 2

### Interval Results

- interval_overlap_ratio = 0.85
